This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

#install.packages("ggplot2",dependencies = TRUE)

#install.packages("reshape2")

library("ggplot2")
library("reshape2")

setwd("/home/ramakanth7618/git_demo_iplant/output")

data.in <- read.delim(file = "combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t")

newdata.in <- subset(data.in, country == "India" | country == "China" | country == "Pakistan" )
# try this at home  -- summary(newdata.in)

#ggplot(newdata.in, aes(year, gdpPercap)) + geom_point(size = 3) + facet_grid (country #~ .)


```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#plot(cars)
ggplot(newdata.in, aes(year, gdpPercap)) + geom_point(size = 3) + 
  facet_grid (country ~ .)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
